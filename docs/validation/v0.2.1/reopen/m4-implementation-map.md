# M4: the implementation map of revision 4 (declared before any test or code of M4)

Status: **declared 2026-10-18, before the first test and the first line of code of M4.** It adds
no criterion: the acceptance criteria are those of revision 3, section 10, and revision 4
(`corrections-plan-rev4.md`, approved version SHA-256 in `corrections-plan-rev4.sha256`), sections 1
to 5. This file says where each correction goes in the code, how it is switched, and which tests
carry which criterion, so that the order "criteria, then tests, then code" can be checked per piece.

## The switch

- A new plan section, `gauntlet.corrections` (`CorrectionsParams` in `params.py`), holds the
  settings of a configuration (revision 3, 9.2: `B_min`, `gap_split`, `fap_max`, `max_components`,
  `k_clip`, `h_min`, `m_beta`; revision 4: `R_min`) and **`enabled: bool`, default `false`**. With
  `enabled: false` every analysis is the M3 code path, byte for byte: the test suite and every
  existing claim behave as before.
- Each correction reads the switch; no correction runs with it off.
- **The freeze of M4** (revision 3, 9.3) is one commit that sets the defaults of `CorrectionsParams`
  to the chosen configuration with `enabled: true`, because the population harness v2 passes the fast
  plan and takes every other value from the code's defaults (`../population-study.md`, section 7).
  Before that commit, any existing test whose expectation is the M3 behavior gets an explicit
  `corrections: {enabled: false}` in its plan, in a commit of its own, with this paragraph as its
  declared justification (exit criterion 4): it then tests the same code path as before. A test of
  the baseline list that cannot be kept that way is listed in `../baseline/justifications.txt`
  before the freeze commit.

## The pieces, in the order of revision 4

| # | Correction (revision 3 / 4) | Module | Tests (criteria of revision 3, 10, and revision 4) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | A1: correlated noise from the data, binned rms (rev 3, 2.1) | `rednoise.py` (new): segments, binned `σ_w`, `σ_r²(n)`, `β(n)`, the few-bins rule | `tests/test_rednoise.py`: white β(n_T) within 1 ± 0.1; AR(1) β within 15% of its analytic value; bins never cross a gap or a mask; a sector below `B_min` excluded and reported; none left: undetermined |
| 2 | A1 propagation (rev 3, 2.2): per-event and stacked depths, candidate error and SNR | `events.py`, `search.py`, `gauntlet.py` (behind the switch) | `tests/test_rednoise_propagation.py`: white noise, the gate unchanged within 5%; the per-event variance formula; events sharing cadences dropped; switch off: byte-identical results |
| 3 | Timing with an ingress model (rev 3, 3) | `ephemeris.py` (trapezoid template, scan, error × β(n_τ)) | `tests/test_timing_trapezoid.py`: per-transit error within 30% of the Carter reference (white); pulls of 200 seeded transits within the K margins; an edge minimum discarded; same input, same times |
| 4 | Holdout: replica spans and the hidden-window variance (rev 4, 1) | `holdout.py` (`plan_round` registers replicas; `HiddenYear` masks them and gives logged access) | `tests/test_holdout_replicas.py`: the unit criteria of rev 4, 1 (variance within 15%, white and AR(1); the full operation's pulls within the K margins; too few replicas: `hidden_noise_undetermined`; no overlap; masked fraction ≤ 0.5; determinism) |
| 5 | Holdout: the baseline model of a window, decisions 1 and 2, the FAIL rule (rev 3, 4.1, 4.3 to 4.5; rev 4, 1 and 2) | `holdout.py` | `tests/test_holdout_capacity.py`: rev 3, 10, rows 4.1, 4.2-4.4 and 4.5, and row N (bit-equal decision 2 for hidden years equal outside the windows) |
| 6 | `period_alias`, the only definition (rev 3, 5; rev 4, 3) | `battery.py` | `tests/test_period_alias_rev4.py`: the four regimes; the three undefined cases INCONCLUSIVE; the raw curve as input; the systematic-period warning kept |
| 7 | Prewhitening (rev 3, 7; rev 4, 4) | `prewhiten.py` (new), used by the search, the reanalysis and the holdout train | `tests/test_prewhiten.py`: a transit under a stronger sinusoid found; a pure sinusoid removed; a pure box not removed; the sequence of rev 4, 4 (L0, clip set, L1, the FAP at `f*`); no class or truth argument; `period_alias` receives the raw curve |

Every piece: its tests are committed before its code; the tests are run on white and on correlated
noise (the generator's correlated mode); its sabotages are planned in the test commit and their
results recorded after the code. With the switch off, the full suite is unchanged (checked after
each piece). Nothing of M4 is measured on the development population before the freeze, the
calibration of the estimators (with the timing lot first, `calibration-ceiling-decision.md`) and
the maintainer's approval of `points.json`.
